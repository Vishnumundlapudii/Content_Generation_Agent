## Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seamlessly integrated into our daily lives

AI aids us in routine tasks to facilitating complex decision-making processes. However, a significant evolution in the AI landscape is underway, transitioning from conventional AI models to AI agents. This article, inspired by Nir Diamant's guide "Your First AI Agent: Simpler Than You Think", will explore the fundamental principles of AI agents, their real-world applications, and potential limitations.

AI agents propose a revolutionary approach to artificial intelligence. Contrary to traditional AI models that function independently, an AI agent behaves akin to a proficient coordinator. It manages multiple capabilities while maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the task at hand. Endowed with the capacity to make data-driven decisions based on its continuous learning, an AI agent emulates the decision-making protocol of a human expert.

## The principles underpinning AI agents are captivating

They encompass concepts such as state management, a decision-making framework, and the effective use of tools. State management pertains to the agent's ability to monitor its environment, adapt to changes, and track its progress towards its goal. The decision-making framework is...
